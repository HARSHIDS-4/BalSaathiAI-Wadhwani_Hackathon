# BalSaathiAI 🌱
### *Har Baccha, Sahi Samay — Every Child, At The Right Time*

> AI-powered early developmental screening platform for children aged 0–6 years in rural India, built for Anganwadi and ASHA workers on the frontlines.

## 🚨 The Problem

In India, **13.7 million children** live with developmental disabilities. The majority are identified only after age 5–6 — well past the critical 0–3 year intervention window. India's **1.4 million Anganwadi workers** — the people closest to these children — have no standardized, AI-assisted tool to screen for delays during routine home visits.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

BalSaathiAI lets a frontline worker screen a child across four developmental domains in under 5 minutes, get a real-time AI risk classification, generate a referral, and track whether the family actually followed through.

```
Worker selects child
      ↓
Answers domain-wise milestone questions
(Speech & Language → Motor Skills → Social & Emotional → Cognitive)
      ↓
"No" answers trigger adaptive follow-up questions
      ↓
Complete answer set sent to FastAPI /predict endpoint
      ↓
Trained Logistic Regression model returns risk classification
      ↓
🟢 On Track | 🟡 Watch | 🔴 Refer Now
      ↓
If Refer Now → referral generated → follow-up tracked
```

---

## 🧠 The AI — Real, Not Mocked

A trained scikit-learn **Logistic Regression** model (`model.pkl`) is loaded by FastAPI at startup and called on every screening submission. No hardcoded outputs.

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | Logistic Regression (Pipeline: ordinal encoding → feature selection → classifier) |
| Test Accuracy | 0.84 |
| Macro F1 | 0.84 |
| Training data | 50,000-record synthetic dataset, ASQ-3-informed weighted labels |
| Full evaluation | See [`EVALUATION.md`](./EVALUATION.md) |

Full training, model comparison (RF vs XGBoost vs LR), and age-feature ablation study documented in [`BalSaathi AI.ipynb`](./BalSaathi%20AI.ipynb).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Adaptive AI Screening** — "No" responses trigger targeted follow-up questions per domain
- **3-Level Risk Flagging** — On Track / Watch / Refer Now with domain-level context
- **Smart Referral Generation** — nearest RBSK centre + parent WhatsApp message
- **Follow-Up Tracking** — closes the loop after referral
- **Supervisor Dashboard** — block-level screening coverage and pending cases
- **Multilingual UI** — Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, English
- **Worker Training Module** — swipeable illustrated guides

## 🚀 Setup — Run Locally

This project has **two parts**: React frontend + FastAPI backend. Both must run together.

### Option A — Docker (Recommended for Backend)

```bash
# Pull the backend image from Docker Hub
docker pull harshi16gupta/balsaathi

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 harshi16gupta/balsaathi
```

Backend runs at `http://localhost:8000`
API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

---

### Option B — Run Backend Without Docker

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate        # Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start FastAPI server
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

---

### Frontend (both options)

```bash
# In a separate terminal
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`



---

## 🐳 Docker Hub

**Image:** [`harshi16gupta/balsaathi`](https://hub.docker.com/r/harshi16gupta/balsaathi)

```bash
docker pull harshi16gupta/balsaathi
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 harshi16gupta/balsaathi
```

## 📄 Documentation

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`EVALUATION.md`](./EVALUATION.md) | Dataset, train/test split, model comparison, confusion matrix |
| [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) | Pilot plan, infrastructure cost, scaling path |
| [`BalSaathi AI.ipynb`](./BalSaathi%20AI.ipynb) | Full ML pipeline — EDA, training, ablation study |

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

BalSaathiAI is a **triage and referral support tool** — not a diagnostic system. Model is trained on a clinically-informed **synthetic** dataset; real-world validation is the explicit goal of our proposed Phase 2 pilot. See `EVALUATION.md` for full disclosure.
